Basics
------

Import
++++++
amr_sim is built from the pygame library and uses lots of objects
from this library, so importing the pygame library is required for some
the use some of the amr_sim objects. The only classes needed for the basic
simulation is :class:Simulation and :class:basic_images::
    import pygame
    from amr_sim import Simulation, basic_images

Create screen
+++++++++++++
Creating an instalnce of the :class:Simulation class requires the dimensions of 
desired screen in pixels and the desired maximum update rate of the Simulation::
    screen_dim = 500, 500
    update_rate = 60

    sim = Simulation(screen_dim, update_rate)
